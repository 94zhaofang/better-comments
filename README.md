# Better Comments

The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.
With this extension, you will be able to categorise your annotations into:
* Alerts
* Queries
* TODOs
* Removed code will also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there!

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: A list of `TODO` messages in your project can be found on the `Tasks` output window
